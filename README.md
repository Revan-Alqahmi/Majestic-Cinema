# Majestic-Cinema

This is my project in the Database 2 course at Umm Al-Qura University.

This project aims to address the need for a comprehensive cinema database to improve data management and enhance customer experiences. Without a database, manual and paper-based systems can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and delays in processing customer orders. This can result in providing inaccurate information to customers and prolonged wait times for processes like seat selection, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction. Furthermore, limited data handling capabilities can hinder the ability of movie theaters to accommodate growth, introduce new features, and compete with other cinemas. By developing a dedicated database, this project aims to overcome these challenges, optimize data management, and enable cinemas to provide accurate and efficient services to their customers.

Therefore, we worked to build our own database from scratch using MongoDB, with several entities such as branches, employees, customers, and others.
